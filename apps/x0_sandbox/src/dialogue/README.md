# Visual Novel

Use HTML for dialogue boxes and UI elements.
- This allows for CSS AND accessibility.
- Also, you can translate a lot easier.

The scenes are on a canvas. This can be alt described
and or animated.

There is generally very little interactivity, so most
of it is watching an animation that is stepped through
by the dialogue.

The SCRIPT of the dialogue should be decoupled but is
important to actually writing the visual novel.

Consider looking into other visual novel scripts to
see what is possible and add/import that.
