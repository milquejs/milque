/**
 * @module View
 * @version 1.1.0
 * 
 * A view is a section of a world that is drawn onto a section of a
 * display. For every view, there must exist a camera and viewport.
 * However, there could exist multiple cameras in the same view
 * (albeit inactive).
 * 
 * A viewport is the section of the display that shows the content.
 * Since viewports generally change with the display, it is calculated
 * when needed rather than stored. Usually, you only want the full display
 * as a viewport.
 * 
 * A camera is the view in the world space itself. This usually means
 * it has the view and projection matrix. And because of its existance
 * within the world, it is often manipulated to change the world view.
 * 
 * Another way to look at it is that viewports hold the destination
 * dimensions of a view, whilst the camera holds the source transformations
 * that are applied to a view's source canvas (its buffer) dimension.
 * The size of the view buffer should never change (unless game resolution
 * and aspect ratio changes).
