The Infrastructure determines the loot table.

That means all lower level planets will NEED Nutrients
But all upper level planets won't.

Should there be a persistent trade route?

What is fun?
Traders: Trading low / high.
Builders: Supporting a civilization.

Unique items per system.


Cultures Needs (determines the values of the trade items and the crew requirements)

Green
Yellow

= Level 4 5000 - 10000
Black


Trade differences should lead to the player DOING more fun things.
- So keep random, but deterministic differences should be because of danger or something fun.

Maybe:
- The universe has stablized all trade routes, so every system, if not producing something, has
a (or a few) trade routes to other systems for the other goods. Events can disrupt those trade
routes and cause prices to plummet / sky-rocket within the system. Therefore, the player can
prepare a bunch of items to travel a dangerous and long journey out to another system.

NEEDS:
- If out of fuel, will spend a lot of time (and therefore resources) and end up at one
of the nearby planets. There's a low chance to land on a deserted planet, which then you lose
everything but is able to escape the planet after a long time on a derelict (or broken) ship.
- If out of food, all ability / stat chances are 0. Morale decreases. Fuel is consumed (at a higher rate) instead after a few days.
    - Allow rationing?

You are on a derelict ship. Sitting in the cockpit, you see an empty control panel before you. You notice a switch nearby. Perhaps it still works?

Command Center
- Prints Stats
- Shows command target / queue / destination
- Lists commands to execute

Command discovery System
