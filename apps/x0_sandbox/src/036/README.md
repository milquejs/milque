A detective game in the style of Wes Anderson. 

We are telling a murder mystery, who is being written by the writer.

It gives hard facts, but you can never shake off the feeling that SOMEONE is telling you all this (me). There's a right and wrong, but it's a skewed persepctive.


Mechanics:

Case of the Red Pelican.

Someone has stolen a Red Jewel.

Three suspects were at the scene.

A chef.

A art gallery person.

A security guard.


Build the schedule of each person?
- This is by traits, profession, habits, personality, life circumstance, etc.

- 1. MURDER SCENE
    - Someone is dead. And suspects are gathered.
- 2. Interrogation
    - People explain their whereabouts and themselves.
    - Clues are identified.
- 3. Red Herring / Twist
    - 
- 4. Reveal
- 5. Rationale / Epilogue
