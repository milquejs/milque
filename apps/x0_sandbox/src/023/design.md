You take care of a cactus.

- The seasons change with the player. It is in real time.
- It should use the same weather data from the player's location.
- It will poop and needs to eat and nap.

- You have an item menu, where you can buy food and a dust bin to clean up the poop.
- You can also buy it toys.
- It will play with it.

It has life stages:
- Egg -> Death (happy or sad)

So it has a happiness meter (that is hidden). You can see it on its face.
It has a hunger meter (it appears above its head).
It has wants (as thought bubbles).

Has minigames to play to earn points to buy these things.

They can cross breed and have different skins.
